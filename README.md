# Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier for Movie Reviews

## Project Overview
This repository features an implementation of a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier is trained to discern the sentiment of movie reviews from a large dataset, categorizing each review as either positive or negative.

## Model and Dataset Details
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classifier known for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a comprehensive movie review dataset, which provides a rich variety of textual data for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.

## Additional Insights
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Alongside sentiment prediction, this project also includes a visual representation of the data in the form of word clouds. These word clouds highlight the most frequent words found in positive and negative movie reviews, offering an intuitive grasp of the language patterns associated with sentiments.

## Purpose
- The aim of this repository is not only to present a functional text classifier but also to offer an educational tool for understanding the application of Naive Bayes in natural language processing.

Feel free to delve into the code, model, and visualizations to better comprehend how sentiment analysis can be achieved through machine learning.
